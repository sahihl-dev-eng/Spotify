# Spotify


This is just backend of the app spotify which I have created using Js Framework like Express along with backend written in Node Js. 
In this middleware are admin.js, auth.js, validObjectId. This folder contains information like payload, authentication and payload paramters are defined.
Routes contains auths.js, songs.js, users.js, playlists.js, search.js. In this folder routes are defined from which all crud operation like get,post,delete and put are defined.
Models contain playlist.js, user.js, song.js.In this folder all schemas are defined.
Along with index.js is starter file from where app would run.
All env variable are contained in .env file.
All this routes are tested in postman and working all well.
